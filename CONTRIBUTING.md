## Pull request procedure

Pull requests should be targeted at Numerical's `master` branch.
Before pushing to your Github repo and issuing the pull request,
please do two things:

1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your
   local changes against the `master` branch. Resolve any conflicts
   that arise.

2. Run the tests and benchmark suite! If theres no tests or benchmarks for your contribution, be sure to add them.


3. All commits need to be signed off by their author, as a means of communicating that the contributions are in accordance with the project's open source license terms.
