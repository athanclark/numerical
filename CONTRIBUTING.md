# Wellposed Contributor License Agreement

Why is this agreement necessary?
We very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to Wellposed!

Note that the following agreement is not a transfer of copyright ownership, this simply is a license agreement for contributions. You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose, subject to the terms of any license agreement between you and Wellposed with respect to your use of Wellposed software.

For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:

* Django's excellent [CLA FAQ](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/)

* A [well-written chapter](http://producingoss.com/en/copyright-assignment.html) from Karl Fogel's Producing Open Source Software on CLAs

* The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_license_agreement) on CLAs

This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.

If you have more questions, shoot Carter an email  or drop by #wellposed or #numerical-haskell on IRC on freenode.
